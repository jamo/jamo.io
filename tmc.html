          <h3>What is TestMyCode -project?</h3>
          <p>Test My Code (“TMC”) is a suite of tools that has been designed to make the life of
          programming instructors and students easier, as well as provide beneficial input for
          computing education researchers. See <a href="http://testmycode.github.io">testmycode.github.io</a>
          for more details.</p>

          <h3>Background in the TestMyCode -project</h3>
          <p>The TestMyCode project was started in early 2011 as a software engineering lab project
          initiated by the Rage-research-group at the University of Helsinki dept. of computer
          science. The initial foundation contained of the:
          <dd>
            <dl>TMC-Server</dl>
            <dt>Ruby on Rails 3.x server providing API for the TMC-NetBeans to download exercise
            templates and submit exercises to be graded automatically by our systems, as well as some basic
            bookkeeping properties for teachers.</dt>
            <dl>TMC-NetBeans</dl>
            <dt>NetBeans plugin for downloading exercise templates provided by the TMC-Server as
            well as submitting exercise to be graded.</dt>
          </dd>
          </p>

          <p>
          Soon after the software lab course had completed one of the project instructors
          <a href="https://github.com/mpartel">mpartel</a> started taking care; maintaining and
          developing the TMC-project.

          Soon most if not all of the code was rewritten and multiple important security
          improvements was done.

          The most important improvement regarding security and thus providing steady foundation for
          this project is how the submissions are run and graded by the service.

          The grading is basically done by unit tests (with out special flavour); test being
          provided by the course instructors....

          However as we are executing arbitrary code of our students and other participants for the
          course we cannot neglect the security of malicious code.

          Thus we moved from the initial solution of executing code with "security" provided by Java
          Security Manager to having real sandboxes.

          Thus became TMC-Sandbox. TMC-Sandbox is a modified UML linux sandbox. Not going to deep
          details here. To find more about it, please see:

          <h3>My role and background in the TestMyCode -project?</h3>
          <p>
          I stared getting interested of the project in early 2012 and soon after (fall 2012) started
          committing to the project.
          Initially just squashing bugs of the TMC-Netbeans and our edu-test-utls (some nasty
          encoding issues with osx...).

          And then slowly moving towards TMC-server and our other products.

          Early 2013 I took part in software engineering lab project at UH. In the project we (me
          and the others (github.com/rase- and github.com/kviiri) were supposed to add support for
          the C programming language. (initially we had only support for Java (and and maven).
          Thanks to nice design, adding support for the new language didn't require any
          architectural changes and still we had the chance to dig deep into TMC-servers core.

          We ended up quickly adding support for Makefile based exercises in general (just only C).

          We had the whole spring 2013 to use and during this time we did various other
          improvements. To highlight one, we added support for paste's
          (e.g. user can share her code straight from comfort of her editor and get shareable link
          to her submission.
          This feature has proven itself to be one of the most important features for TA's and
          volunteers helping students remotely with the programming assignments.


          After this project I continued actively contributing to the TMC-project and soon achieved
          status of the second "owner" <!--bad term--> of the TMC-project.

          Not long after this I became also the second maintainer of our service providing.
          (Support for our users (course instructors and TA's) and I got into maintaining server we
          run the application.

          Ever since I'v been on-call for tmc.mooc.fi/. Our SLA is, well, best effort basically.
          </p>
          <h4>Our stack</h4>
          <p>
          Partially due to the nature of what we are doing and especially the TMC-Sandbox we have a
          few physical machines from a DC. Where we run our products on KVM virtual machines.
          </p>

            edu-test-utils provides support for finding and invoking methods with Java reflection (just making it
            easier for course instructors to provide tests which will always compile even when
            students haven't yet declared the class/methods testes.). And provides support for easily
            accessing stdout and mocking stdin of the Java programs to be tested.
          -->

            I also like cooking and play tennis.
