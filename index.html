            Introduction
          </header>
            <p>
              Hello, my name is Jarmo, but you can also call me Jamo.
              <br />
              <br />
              I'm currently working as Software Engineer in Rage Research in the University of Helsinki.
              Recently I had one year internship at Google Switzerland where I worked on implementing various telephony systems.
              <br />
              I'm also a fifth year Computer Science student of the University of Helsinki.
              <br />
              <br />
              For as long as I can remember, I have spent most of my time with computers;
              programming and learning about new cool stuff.
              <br />
              <br />
              I'd call myself an open source aficionado. I love Ruby, JavaScript - and whenever I have time I try to contribute on various OSS projects.
              <br />
              <br />
              I'm also the core developer of the <a href="#testmycode">TestMyCode</a>, a student submission grading system,
              that integrates to IDE and let's students to immediately start working in real development environments while learning.
              It gathers detailed information regarding students' programming process for researchers to use.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can find me working on a cool new project, contributing to various OSS projects, teaching programming/java for our students and supporting our <a href="#mooc.fi">MOOC</a> courses
              - or sailing around the Baltic sea, skiing in the most beautiful Swiss and Austrian alps.
              <br />
              <br />
              You can find photos I've taken while sailing around the Baltic Sea, skiing at
              the most beautiful Swiss and Austrian alps, enjoying the Finnish nature and
              travelling around interesting places, mostly in Europe and the USA from my
              <a href="http://instagram.com/jarmoisotalo">Instagram</a> and
              <a href="http://flikr.com/Jamo_">Flikr</a> profiles.
              <br />
              And all the pictures on my site are mine.
              <br />
              I also like cooking, playing tennis, and I have keen interest on security and web technologies.

              The core developer and maintainer of the TestMyCode projects.
              Test My Code ("TMC") is a suite of tools that has been designed to make the life of
              programming instructors and students easier, as well as provide beneficial input for
              computing education researchers.

              TMC integrates to real IDE allowing students to immediately start working in real development environments while learning programming.
              From IDE, it also  gathers detailed information regarding students' programming process for researchers to use.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              TMC is available in both self hosted and SAAS, there are at least three universities and a few university of applied sciences using the SAAS version that I host. On average day during peak hours we get about 20 QPS to the Rails app.
              <br/>
              Even thou we are hosting on commodity hardware, we've been able to maintain four nines availability
            <h3>Mentionable achievements</h3>
            <p>
              I've done lots of work and cool features for the TestMyCode project. To mention a few:
              <ul>
                <li>in addition to NewRelic, I've setup ELK stack in distributed manner and a neat dashboard of all of the important metrics to improve visibility and make future planning easier.</li>
                <li>Improved performance by better utilizing caching (both client and server side), optimizing SQL queries, and usage of rails features.</li>
                <li>Optimized deployment, and set up proper staging and canary instances.</li>
                <li>Currently I'm leading one of the biggest refactorings of the client side application logic</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>
              For the hosted setup, I've basically been on-call for last three years. Thanks to proper design, proper testing and proper usage of canary instances I've been able to sleep my nights without unnecessary pages.
              However, the use of commodity hardware has certainly caused a few partial outages due to network errors - which frankly is the cause of most of the pages.

            <p>
              Ever since we released our first Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) in early 2012, I've been closely involved on creating the courses, supporting the community etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of our MOOC courses works also as an entrance exam for your department, in years 2013-16 I've been closely involved in organizing the interviews;
              setting up everything for the interviewers and interviewees and looking after that everything runs smoothly.
              <br />
              A typical MOOC entrance exam has consists of a computer exam followed by an individual interview. Each spring we have had around 200-300 applicants interviewed on location.
              For this I also created the <a href="/mooc-master">MOOC-Master -application</a> which is used for the applicants to reserve their interviews, and to track progress of the applicants.

                <li>Set up reliable material build pipeline, which builds and distributes the material among multiple hosts.</li>
                <li>Created a bunch of exercises</li>
                <li>Maintained, updated and fixed all kinds of issues of MOOC.fi site, courses and materials ever since early 2012.</li>

            <p>
              I've setup a bunch of video surveillance cameras in a distributed manner with motion and motioneye. There are utilized in both my home and our summer cottage to look for suspicious activity and to get a nice overview on how it looks. As my cameras are behind ISP NAT, they all reverse tunnel back to one of my VPS and thus gets exposed to the internet.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've also set up temperature and humidity sensors at both home and summer cottage. These both offer a web interface as well as log in short intervals to Google Spreadsheets, in which visualizing and exploring rather long (100k lines) is still relatively fast.
            </p>
            <p>
              My next project on small electronics is to create a web remote control for our AC units which are IR controlled.

        During this summer I worked as the tech lead of the development done to improve and add features to the TestMyCode. I coordinated work of 7 other developers in Rage Research, who were working on client and server side features for the TestMyCode.
        The 7 developers were split into two smaller teams and with each we had separate scrum meetings and task prioritization. We pushed out new features and improvements weekly.
        </p>
        <p>
        This fall I've continued where the two teams left of. Biggest task is to finalize merge of our two different instances of the tmc-server to one instance with full support for organizations and finalize process of redesigning the core of our client side plugins to be more extendable and to make it easier to bring in support for new IDE's
        </p>
        <p>
        I've been also working on improving monitoring and alerting and configured ELK stack for log analysis.

        I did my internship in the internal Google Telephony Team. In which I quickly became active team member.
        During my internship I worked in a few different projects with different members of my team.
        The projects were mostly about building new systems which used internal Google technologies, mostly working in the telephony side.
        During my internship I also configured monitoring for all the systems I was building, held training sessions for support organization and on-call.
        </p>

        All of the projects were implemented Java using wide variety of internal Google technologies.
